## Features

- Nimmo is a modular personal assistant. He's designed to be flexible and extensible.

- Right now, he comes with the following capabilities:

  - He can talk by **Telegram**. There's a security restriction that prevents him from talking to strangers. You can change the env var `TELEGRAM_CHATID` to get him to talk only to you.

  - His brain is OpenAI's ChatGPT, so we can say Nimmo inherits all the features of this AI model (he speaks 95 natural languages, he knows how to code, he can give really useful insights about a lot of topics, etc...)

  - He can check the weather forecasts in your area. He ingests a really big amount of raw data (humidity, UV levels, wind, etc...) and makes a friendly summary for you.

  - He can check and summarize the latest news. In just a few seconds he will read several 100s of newspapers and he will make a short summary of them in just a few lines. You can then talk with him about those news.

  - He can also read the latest scientific papers published on **Nature\*** and he creates a friendly summary of the new findings. This helps me to stay up to date with the state of the art on the scientific community.

\* _I'm currently working on extending this capability to enable Nimmo to read and summarize scientific papers on many more journals._
