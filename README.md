# Nimmo

> _"If you guard your mind carefully and keep it blank of any clutter of information till maturity is reached, filling it only with intelligence and training it only in clear thinking, you then have a powerful instrument at your disposal"_

This project is the continuation of [Luna](https://github.com/JoseHervas/luna), my first personal assistant chatbot.

The emergence of ChatGPT changed the rules of AI assistants, so I decided to start a completely new virtual assistant from scratch using [🦜️🔗 LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)

## How to use

```bash
# Download the repo
git clone https://github.com/JoseHervas/nimmo

# (Optional) Create a virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the env variables
cp .env.template .env

# Run
python src/main.py
```
